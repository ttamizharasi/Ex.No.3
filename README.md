### DATE:  14/03/2025                                                                         
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222040170

### Aim: 
Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques.

### Algorithm:  
The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation

## 1. Scenario Design & Data Collection
 1. Technique: Role Prompting
Prompt Example:

You are a retail customer experiencing difficulty tracking your order. Ask the chatbot for help in a polite but urgent tone.

Purpose: Simulate varied customer emotions and tones for chatbot training data.

 2. Technique: Few-Shot Prompting
Prompt Example:

Customer: “Where’s my order?”
Bot: “Let me check that for you. Can you share your order ID?”
Customer: “Here’s my ID: 123456”
Bot: “Thanks! Your order is out for delivery and should arrive by 7 PM today.”

Purpose: Generate synthetic conversations for training and evaluation datasets.

## 2. Model Training & Experimentation
 1. Technique: Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Prompt Example:

A customer wants to return a damaged item. First, ask for the order ID. Then, verify the return policy. Finally, offer return instructions.

Purpose: Train the model to follow logical support flows.

 2. Technique: Instruction Prompting
Prompt Example:

Given a user query, classify it as one of the following: Order Status, Return Request, Product Inquiry, Store Info, Complaint.

Purpose: Enhance intent classification using direct task instructions.

## 3. Data Analysis & Evaluation
 1. Technique: Zero-Shot Prompting
Prompt Example:

Classify the customer query: “Can you tell me if this product comes in red?”

Purpose: Test the chatbot’s generalization capabilities on unseen query types.

 2. Technique: Reflexive Prompting (Self-Critique)
Prompt Example:

Here is the chatbot’s response: “Sorry, I can’t help you.”
Evaluate whether this reply is helpful, and suggest a better alternative.

Purpose: Evaluate model performance and improve response relevance.

## 4. Report Creation
 1. Technique: Persona Prompting
Prompt Example:

You are an AI researcher presenting findings to retail business stakeholders. Summarize the performance of the chatbot in layman’s terms.

Purpose: Make the report accessible to non-technical readers.

 2. Technique: Comparative Prompting
Prompt Example:

Compare the chatbot’s performance before and after using fine-tuned intent classification. Use metrics like accuracy, response time, and satisfaction rate.

Purpose: Support claims with clear data comparisons.

## Experiment Workflow Summary

1. Stage	Prompt Type	Purpose
